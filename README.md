This repository contains code for a library I made in Rust to work with [CLIPS](https://clipsrules.net/). I was using CLIPS for a project, but eventually decided to make my own rules engine and replace CLIPS completely. You won't find these crates on crates.io because I don't want to spend time maintaining something that is unlikely to be used by other people, so if you believe it might be useful for you, contact me and I might be able to polish it up, write some documentation for it and release it more broadly.
